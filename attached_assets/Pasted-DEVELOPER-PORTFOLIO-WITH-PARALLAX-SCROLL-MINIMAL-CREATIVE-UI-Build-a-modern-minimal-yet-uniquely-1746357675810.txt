DEVELOPER PORTFOLIO WITH PARALLAX SCROLL, MINIMAL & CREATIVE UI
Build a modern, minimal yet uniquely creative developer portfolio website using React (Next.js preferred) and Tailwind CSS (or styled-components). The site must use a parallax scrolling effect, where each scroll transitions smoothly to a new full-screen section, with seamless, inertia-based motion and subtle but clever animations.

üîß Core Design & Aesthetic
Visual Style: Minimalistic layout with lots of white/negative space, but enhanced by subtle creative flair ‚Äî such as asymmetric grid layouts, layered elements, floating text, or animated typography.

Colors: Use a soft, neutral base (white, charcoal, or off-black) with 1‚Äì2 carefully chosen accent colors (like electric blue or muted coral). Add dark mode support with a toggle.

Typography: Bold display font for section headers, clean sans-serif for body text. Preferably use a variable font for expressive transitions.

Microinteractions: Use hover states, animated underlines, magnetic buttons, and scroll-triggered fades/slides.

üåÄ Scroll & Parallax Effects
Implement scroll snapping to lock into each section with smooth transitions.

Add parallax layers: foreground elements (text, buttons) scroll at normal speed, background elements scroll slower or move subtly in response to scroll.

Use GSAP + ScrollTrigger (or Framer Motion if using React) to manage animations.

Optional: Add a custom cursor or animated scroll indicator to guide interaction.

üìÑ Sections (Each is Fullscreen & Scrollable)
Hero ‚Äì Name, short tagline (e.g., ‚ÄúCreative Frontend Developer‚Äù), a background video or interactive canvas, CTA button ("View My Work").

About Me ‚Äì Short personal intro, circular image or SVG avatar, 3 unique fact-bubbles or an animated traits list.

Projects ‚Äì Interactive grid or carousel. Each project opens a modal with animated details. Hover effects: color shifts, subtle zoom, or morphing shapes.

Tech Stack ‚Äì Animated icons that pop into view, grouped by Frontend, Backend, Tools.

Timeline ‚Äì Creative visual resume (could use vertical or horizontal scroll). Animate in entries as the user scrolls.

Contact ‚Äì Simple contact form, social links, CV download. Optional: Include an animated map or abstract illustration here.

üß† Creative Additions (Optional but Recommended)
Background Elements: Subtle animated SVGs, 3D blobs, or WebGL effects (Three.js) that react to scroll or cursor.

Floating Particles: Tie them to scroll speed or cursor direction.

Cursor Trail / Magnetic Buttons: Add delight to interaction without cluttering the UI.

Custom Section Transitions: Think swipe-reveal effects or morphing SVG masks between sections.

Easter Eggs: Hide a small interactive mini-project or a fun command-line interface section.
